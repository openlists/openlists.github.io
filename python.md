## Overview

Python is a popular general-purpose programming language, with a lot of available materials covering lots of different topics. This list is focused on curating materials focused on learning the basics of the Python programming language (the standard library), as well as the tools available for numerical and scientific computing.

The Python programming language is managed by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/), which hosts their own [documentation page](https://docs.python.org/3/), as well as their own guide on [getting started with Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

In terms of **version**, Python is now firmly on Python3, and it is recommended to use the most recent 3.X stable release of Python. Note that Python2 is [effectively retired](https://python3statement.org), and there are many useful updates that make Python3 [worth updating to](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/python3_with_pleasure).

In terms of **distributions and/or platforms** to manage Python, there are many, but a pretty typical approach is to use the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to get and manage Python, and to use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) ecosystem, including their notebooks, for interactive computing.

For more generalized lists of Python resources, there are some other relevant lists:
- the [awesome Python list](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) of everything Python
- the [awesome Jupyter list](https://github.com/markusschanta/awesome-jupyter) of everything Jupyter
- the [awesome scientific Python list](https://github.com/rossant/awesome-scientific-python) of scientific Python

## Scientific Python

'Scientific Python' refers to the tools and communities in Python that focus on numerical, scientific & data applications. 

Generally, this is clustered around the [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/about.html) ecosystem.

The core scientific computing tools in Python include:
- [numpy](https://numpy.org) for numerical computing, and data array management
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for managing and analyzing heterogeneous data
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for plotting and all kinds of visualizations
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) for general scientific computing
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) for machine learning

Each of the above tools have their own documentation, user guides and tutorials for learning their respective tools and applications.

### Scipy Lectures
